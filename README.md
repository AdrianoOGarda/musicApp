Welcome to gigstock! 
As Ironhack's Web Devlopment Bootcamp second project, we developed a full stack web application for the live streaming of concerts. It was made using node.js (NODE.JS, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MUX). 
 
To test the application, simply create an account and login! :wink: 

Once inside the app, if registered as a band/musician, you'll be able to upload content and schedule pay concerts for users to buy tickets and assist to the live streaming.
